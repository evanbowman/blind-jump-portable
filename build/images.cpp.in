// This file was generated by the project's image build pipeline in
// CMakeLists.txt. I have no idea why cmake outputs semicolons between the
// entries in the IMAGE_INCLUDES list variable... maybe some special formatting
// character that I don't know about... or maybe cmake uses ; internally as a
// delimiter... but for now, the cmake script outputs the semicolons on a new
// line, commented out, to suppress the resulting errors.
//
// If you try to manually edit source/platform/gba/images.cpp, the file may be
// overwritten if you have the GBA_AUTOBUILD_IMG option in the cmake environment
// turned on.
